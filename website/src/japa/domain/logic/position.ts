/**
 * Merging a devotee's place in a namavali across devices.
 *
 * Every part of the merge is a semilattice — a maximum, or a union — so the
 * whole is commutative, associative and idempotent, and devices converge
 * whatever order rows arrive in and however they are grouped:
 *
 * - **generation** (`practice_version`, then `pass_ordinal`): the higher wins,
 *   so a content reset holds and a finished recitation can't come back.
 * - **marks**: the union of the marks at the winning generation, so a name
 *   chanted on either device stays chanted. Comparing by `hlc` alone would
 *   discard the losing device's names.
 * - **`step_index`**: from the highest `hlc` at the winning generation.
 * - **`deleted_hlc`** with its `deleted_at`: one register, the later of the
 *   two, settled on its own and never competing with the generation. They
 *   travel together — storing only whether the row is *currently* deleted
 *   would lose the timestamp whenever a later edit revived it, and the merge
 *   would stop converging. Whether a position is deleted right now is derived
 *   by {@link isPositionDeleted}, never stored.
 *
 * See docs/japa/decisions/2026-09-22-position-deletion-barrier.md.
