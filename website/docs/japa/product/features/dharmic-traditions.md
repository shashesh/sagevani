# Dharmic traditions

The app serves traditions **native to the Indian subcontinent and wider Indo-Asia** that share name and mantra repetition as a core spiritual practice ([decision](../../decisions/2026-09-21-dharmic-traditions-scope.md)).

## Approach

- **Launch with Hindu traditions** across sampradayas (Vaishnava, Shaiva, Shakta, Smarta, Sai and guru lineages).
- **From P1**, the data model must not hard-code Hindu concepts: tradition, round size, offering style, imagery and calendar are all configurable per tradition.
- **Sikh, Buddhist and Jain in P2.** They share most of the product (malas, mantras, sankalpas, counting modes), so each mainly needs its library, wording, imagery rules and calendar. Advisors should be engaged during P1 so content is ready.
- **An advisor from each tradition** reviews its mantras, content, imagery and wording before release.

| Jain      | Navkar jaap                                                                                       | _Namokar / Navkar Mantra_                                      | 108-bead mala; Svetambara and Digambara nuances                      |

Other traditions of the region (e.g. Kabir Panth, Ravidassia, Bon) can be added later with advisors.

## Sensitivities

- **Imagery is tradition-aware and optional.** Sikh practice, for example, does not depict God.
- **"Offering" wording adapts** per tradition (offering at the lotus feet, dedication of merit in Buddhism, etc.).
- **Calendars differ:** Vikram Samvat, Nepal Sambat, Nanakshahi, Buddhist lunar, Vira Nirvana Samvat.
- **Festivals** per tradition — see [festival-programs](festival-programs.md).
- **"Teacher", not "guru", in app wording** for teacher and temple profiles ([partners](partners-and-revenue.md#partners-p4)). In Sikhism, Guru refers to the ten Gurus and the Guru Granth Sahib. Devotees can still name their own guru, e.g. for a [private guru mantra](mantra-library.md#private-guru-mantra-p1).
